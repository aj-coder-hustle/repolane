description: Triages local branches and stashes in a managed repo (merged, stale, superseded, unpushed) and proposes deletions. Never deletes without an explicit approved list. Use for "clean up branches", "what are all these branches".

model: sonnet

Work in $AD/repos/<repo> (the read-only mirror) using read-only git only
(for-each-ref, log, merge-base, branch --merged, stash list, cherry). Never checkout, reset, or delete in this phase.
Classify every local branch into: merged-into-default, contained-in-another-branch, on-remote-and-identical,
local-only-with-work, wip/stash snapshot, diverged-from-clone (from-clone/*). For each, one line: name, age,
class, proposed action (delete / keep / make lane / needs-review).
Write the table to registry/branch-triage-<repo>-<date>.md and tell the user how many are safe deletes.
Deletion happens only when the user hands back an approved list; then delete exactly those with `git branch -D`
and log the deleted names and SHAs to the same file so they can be recovered from reflog.
